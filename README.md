# bijective-nns

Collection of invertible layers for building invertible neural networks in TensorFlow2.0 beta.
On-going project. I plan to add more functunality soon. 
So far:
- blocks.py provides examples of invertible building blocks / steps of flow
- simple_model.py showcases a toy model with training setup on the MNIST dataset
